Avocado is a bootstrap based, clean, minimal Jekyll theme. 

<a href="#buy-avocado-jekyll-theme" class="btn btn-success">Buy <strike>$35</strike> $20</a>

## Features
Avocado includes a [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/){: target="_blank"} section as well. The theme is suitable for a personal site, portfolio site or a blog.  

### Show off your projects
Show your work on the homepage by updating the list on ``_data/projects.yml``. You can use any font-awesome icon as your project image. 

### Use amazing colors
Don't like the default colors used? Choose a color scheme or use your own colors. Just change the variable ``color-scheme`` in the configuration.

### SEO optimized
The site comes preloaded with SEO optimizations. All the necessary meta tags will be generated for new posts and pages.

Avocado is also enhanced for speed, includes schema and open graph tags. Thus the post links - when shared on social media - will show appropriate title, description and image.


### Responsive videos
Just add a class to your video iframe to make it responsive. For example 

``<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4"></iframe>
``

Adding ``video`` class to any iframe makes it responsive in Avocado.

<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4?start=53&rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Paginated posts
Only 4 posts are shown in one page. Older posts are paginated. [Check it out](/blog){: target="_blank"}. You can change the number of posts in configuration.

``
paginate: 4
``

### Automatic Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs are generated for every page and post automatically. The default one looks like this. 

{% include breadcrumbs.html %}

The color changes with the color scheme.


### Auto generated TOC
Table of contents is automatically generated for each post.

### Get comments 
Disqus comments is pre-installed. Just sign-up, get a shortname and update the variable ``disqus`` in the configuration.

Disqus is configured so that your page load speed will not slow down. Disqus loads when the user goes all the way to the bottom of an article!

If you do not mention the ``disqus:`` value in configuration then the disqus comments code will not be included in the website.

### Track visitors
The website uses Google Analytics for tracking visitors. Use your own UA code in the configuration. Analytics code will not be used in the website if you do not mention UA code.

### Instant search
[Search]({{site.baseurl}}/search/){: target="_blank"} anything from your articles in an instant.

### Auto generated feed and sitemap
We have given much importance to SEO and made sure you have the [sitemap]({{site.baseurl}}/sitemap.xml){: target="_blank"} ready to submit to search engines. A well formatted [feed]({{site.baseurl}}/feed.xml){: target="_blank"} is readily available for RSS.

### Subtle animations
While scrolling through the page, you may observe some important elements fade in slowly. These elements will attract user attention.

### Fully responsive
It will be a pleasure reading content on avocado through a smartphone. Try it to know it.

### Clean code
The website is w3c compliant. We have tried to keep it without any errors.


### Other simple stuff
We have given special importance in designing things like reading time, tags, share buttons, recent articles etc...

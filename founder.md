<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i>Ramya was born in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India on Jan 8th 1991. It all began one hot summer in 1997 when her Grandfather (Inapuri Radha Krishna Rao) , introduced her to this game. She was exposed to all different sports like Badminton, Tennis, Cycling, Carrom and many others but She began to display a special affinity towards the game of chess at a very young age and her Grandfather was really impressed by this. He suggested her parents to take her to a tournament, and this was the beginning of much greater things to come.

Her Mother (Inapuri Lakshmi) and Father (Inapuri Sai Krishna) were the backbone behind her success and both of them played an instrumental role in shaping her as one of the finest talents in the game of chess. Equally supported by her elder sister and grandparents, she dedicates her success to all the people who were a part of the long journey.

At the age of 7, when most kids of her age play with the Barbie dolls, this little genius lived and breathed her black and white chess companion &#8211; the chessboard. And ever since then she has been loving and living for chess !!!

Ramya , a very big fan of Koneru Humpy , wanted to follow her foot steps in winning the National and World Chess Championships and remained successful to a larger extent. The winning spree continued for years to come while she gave equal importance to both academics and chess together during this time. She traveled to more than 30 countries representing India in various Chess Championships and won many laurels.

She took a break from professional chess, as she had to give in for studies during her under-graduation. While pursuing a bachelor&#8217;s degree in engineering,she represented her university in various National and World Universities Championships thus making chess an integral part of every step in her life. Once she graduated, she moved to Bengaluru and started working for Cognizant Technology Solutions, but soon she realized the fact that chess was her forte and will continue to remain the same. She quit her job after working for 8 months and moved to Chicago,Illinois to play some tournaments and teach kids, she wanted to share her knowledge as much as she can.

The move to the United States proved to be worthwhile as she won the World open women&#8217;s Championship, Virginia DC 2013 and stood 2nd in the US women&#8217;s Open, Wisconsin 2013. giving her the much needed confidence. After staying for a while in Chicago, she accepted an offer to teach children at elementary schools in Phoenix, Arizona . She slowly started to build over the base for on-line coaching classes and hired people to work along with her. Now it has grown leaps and bounds with over 100 kids taking coaching classes. The best part about her is that she herself becomes a kid when she is teaching and that is thing which attracted many number of kids. They love her so much and they always look forward for her lessons! She is a fun-loving coach, responsible daughter, most caring friend and die hard fan of chess!

Her unmatched love for the game helped her cross all the barriers she faced and made her a successful player and coach.
